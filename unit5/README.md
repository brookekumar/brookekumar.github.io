# [UNIT 05 - DAY PLANNER - BROOKE KUMAR]

## User Story

AS AN employee with a busy schedule

I WANT to add important events to a daily planner

SO THAT I can manage my time effectively 

-----------------------------

* The application displays timeblocks for standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.).

* Each timeblock contains an input field and save button.

* Clicking a timeblock's "Save" button stores the input text in local storage, allowing the text to persist when the application is refreshed.

* The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar.

* Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in a past, present, or future hour.
